I made this program because I found myself putting things like YouTube on my extra monitors just because they were empty. I felt like I was making up excuses just to have content constantly displaying.

So, I made a program that compliments <a href="https://multiscreenblank.nookkin.com/">MultiscreenBlank</a>. Any monitor that doesn't contain any windows on it will be blanked out <i>automatically</i>.

Most of the program was finished in the first week of development, and after that I have been fixing small bugs that come up through my own personal experience with the software.

I still use this software every day, and I'm extremely thankful to my past self for making it!
